#operators in python (* , + , - , / , **, %)
# ** = power 
able = 5**2
#normal use of operators vs augmented assignment operators 
#1) normal one 
cars = 2
cars = cars + 3
print(cars)
#2) Augmented 
bike = 2 
bike += 3
print(bike)
#more 
truck = 10
truck -= 5
print(truck)
van = 56
van = van -40
print(van)
#more operators 
#(modulus) % = gives the remainder of the division
#/ = division
